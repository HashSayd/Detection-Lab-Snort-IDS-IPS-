# Snort

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to protect the network from any intrusions and analyse threats on an earlier stage. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of firewalls concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analysing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognise attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Virtualbox
- Kali Linux
- Snort as an extension on Pfsense
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
